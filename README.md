## Covid Mobility Analysis

According to Googleâ€™s Community Mobility Report and Apple Mobility Change Reports, as of 03/29/21 the US national mobility trends have increased by 26% compared with the baseline since 01/13/20 (Germany -2%, United Kingdom -6%, Italy - 35%). While the mobility of driving and walking increased accordingly 26% and 24%, the transit mobility decreased by 38%. This phenomenon raises our interests in finding out the key features that have shifted the US mobility trend. 
The purpose of this project is to analyze the changes of mobility pattern in locations with various levels of impact from COVID-19. Our data include information about mobility in the following sectors: Retail & Recreation, Grocery & Pharmacy, Parks, Transit Stations, Work Places, and Residential. We are still in the process of determining our exact research questions. At this stage, our primary interest is in identifying the most relevant features most closely linked to changes in COVID-19 outcomes.
